# Canadian-Diabetes-Demographics-Application

This was a first-year university term project done in collaboration with 3 of my peers.
The ultimate goal was to sort data that was organized in collumns in accordance to the type of data it was i.e. the years each statistic was recorded would all be alligned into one collumn. In the end statistics for each year, province and age group was to be collected and displayed as legible data that could be easily graphed
